## Introduction
  Computer Network simply means computers connected to each other creating an connection that can share information or data through each other. This sharing of data is done through many processes, protocols and methods which we would see further in this documentation.
  
  Protocols are some regulars under which data is exchanged between computers. For example : TCP/IP protocol, UDP protocol and more.

## OSI Model
 OSI Model is a standard model which shows transfer of data between computer through different layers with different functionings.

### Different Layers in OSI Model

- Application Layer
- Presentation Layer
- Session Layer
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer

#### Application Layer :
Application layer is the layer which interact with the user and it is presented on the devices.

#### Presentation Layer :
Presentation Layer is responsible for recieving data from application layer and manipulate it as per the required format for transmistting over the network.
