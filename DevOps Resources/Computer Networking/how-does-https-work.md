# How does HTTPS work?

## What is HTTPS?

**HTTPS**, or **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**, is an extension and secure version of the HTTP. HTTPS transmits encrypted data using *Transport Layer Security (TLS)* in order to increase the security of data transfer. This plays an important role, especially when users want to use online banking or simply brwosing the web.

## How does HTTP work?
HTTPS basically keeps you safe between your browser and the server, where TLS protects the layer of communication between the two from any third-party attackers. TLS uses *cryptography* in order to ensure no data has been tampered with throughout sending and receiving it.

There are 3 things that are encrypted in data. 
1. The data
2. Encryption key
3. Encryption algorithm

The gibberish text in the above image from the https is the **crypher text**. It is produced when you enter the data and the key into the algorithm. The process is simply reversed with the same key to recover the original form of the data and decrypt the cipher text on the other end. The secret encryption key is what allows the entire procedure to function. The data should only be accessible to the designated recipients; otherwise, the goal is lost.Â 

## Why HTTPS is important?
Without the website owner's consent, *Internet service providers (ISPs)* or other middlemen may insert content into webpages on websites without HTTPS.This frequently takes the form of advertising, in which an ISP injects sponsored advertisements into the webpages of its clients in an effort to boost income.Unsurprisingly, when this happens, the website owner is in no way responsible for the adverts' earnings or quality control. Thanks to HTTPS, unmoderated third parties can no longer insert advertisements into site content.
