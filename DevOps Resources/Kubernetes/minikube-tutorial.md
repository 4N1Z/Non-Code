### 游릭 What is Minikube
Minikube is basically one node cluster where the master processes and the work processes run on one node. This node will have a docker container runtime pre-installed so you will be able to run the containers or the pods with containers on this node.

In short, Minikube is a one-node Kubernetes cluster that runs in VirtualBox on your laptop which you can use for testing Kubernetes on your local set-up

### 游릭 What is Kubectl
The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.
