I have written this article to help you guys understand the key UI/UX Design concepts and guidelines that you need to know and remember. 

## User flows:

A user flow shows the steps a user takes to achieve a goal. Sketching these flows is intended to communicate the steps the user takes through different screens 
and actions. They should include a name, step number, and type of user for each flow. As with your initial sketches, user flows don’t need to be pixel perfect or 
contain a lot of detail. In fact the simpler the better! You only need to show the steps you think users will take to complete their task with minimal visuals. 
It’s better to quickly construct flows that you can communicate with your team rather than spend a lot of time developing visuals that may not be technically 
feasible or impactful to the user experience.

## Sitemaps:

Sitemaps are diagrams in a specific order that show how pages are organised. Sitemaps should be created pretty early in the design process, to get a better
understanding of components that are needed to build up the product. They communicate the structure of the product you're building so they’re not just helpful for
you as the designer, but also for the people you’re working with (from developers to content creators).

Sitemaps are a valuable step because it helps to strategically place content where users can find it and aids in the navigation of your product. 
Use the sketches and user flows you created to help you build out your sitemap.

Start with the anatomy of your product and list out all the individual pages. Once you have a list, you can start creating the sitemap. Start with the home page 
at the top. Each section of the sitemap should have a label of the page it's about and a reference number for what step in the process it is.

Color coding or creating a legend for your map may be useful if it is particularly difficult to describe something on the map. It’s up to you how you want to 
lay out the sitemap, left to right or top to bottom, anything works.

## Wireframes:

Wireframes provide a blueprint to your product by detailing information that is displayedon each page, providing an outline and structure to the product, 
and describing the direction and message of your product. It is a way to use everything you've created up to this point to really start putting the site together.
Wireframes will help you better understand how users will navigate through your product and make sure there are efficient pathways. Build off of them and learn 
from the feedback you get to better the product. If you are working on a team, wireframes can help everyone get on the same page with the layout. 
Even if you aren't on a team, get users to test your product. This always uncovers pain points and places where you can improve the user experience of your product. 
Wireframes are also a great way to get feedback from clients. The earlier you can find and fix issues, the easier it will be once we get to the final product.

Remember to keep it simple, more detailed than the sketch, but not the final design. Start with pencil and paper and then move your sketches to a program like
Figma to allow for easier sharing. If you are sharing with a client, add a little more polish to the product to make it look presentable and make sure to explain 
that this is to showcase the interactions, not the visual design of the product.

## Prototypes:

This is the stage where you can start to bring the product to life. Even when you don’t have full designs yet! Using a tool like Figma you can join together the 
screens mapped out in your user flows so that you can easily communicate with your team and/or your client how the design has evolved and how different actions may 
affect the design.

Another great benefit of prototyping your design is that you can test it with users at a stage that is pretty close to how the product will be built. 
This is where you will find out a lot about whether you have made the right assumptions about how users will try to navigate the product and whether the experience
meets their expectations.

## Mobile design:

Having a great user experience in an app is key to having a successful product. You want to make sure users don't have to think too much to use the product. 
If areas of the app are too hard to use or understand, customers may give up. One way to do this is to declutter the unnecessary content and make sure only the
important information remains. Keep the interface clean and minimal and break longer content and tasks into chunks.

When designing forms you can really help users by pre-formatting input fields for better readability, implementing auto-completion, and displaying correctly 
placed hints throughout the task.

## Design systems:

A design system is a single place where all the elements needed to design a product live. It creates a single source of truth for each individual element of the 
design where anyone on a team can easily see and use it.

A common methodology for design systems is atomic design. It is based on the book of the same name by Brad Frost and breaks a design system up into atoms, molecules,
organisms, templates, and pages that work together to create an entire system for a product. Each piece builds on the piece before it and adds more to the design.
